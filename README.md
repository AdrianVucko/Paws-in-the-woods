# Paws-in-the-woods
A 3D game made in unity

Paws in the Woods is an Adventure Singleplayer game that has a heavy focus on the Speedrun style of gameplay. It has several difficulty levels that limit the player's time. The game will contain two levels. One is set in an ordinary forest while the other level is inspired by magic and strange nature.

The main goal of the player as a mother dog is to find all her pups, which are randomly placed on the level, in the shortest possible time. The player passes the level once he has found all the baby dogs. The main challenge in the game is time which can be limited based on what difficulty level the player has set. Also, maneuvering around the map can be challenging due to the amount of objects and due to the lack of a mini-map, due to which the player has to rely on sounds that can reveal where the pups are.
